Perfect, Mahesh 👍 — let’s set up **GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT extensions side‑by‑side in VS Code** so you can use both for your cymatics app development.  

---

## 🛠 Step 1: Install GitHub Copilot
1. Open **VS Code** → go to **Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)**.  
2. Search for **“GitHub Copilot”**.  
3. Click **Install**.  
4. Sign in with your **GitHub account** (you’ll need Copilot enabled on your GitHub subscription).  
5. Once active, Copilot will start suggesting code inline as you type.  

👉 Example: You type `// function to record audio` → Copilot will auto‑suggest the code block.

## 🛠 Step 2: Install ChatGPT Extension
1. In VS Code Extensions, search for **“ChatGPT”** (there are official and community versions — pick one with good reviews).  
2. Install it.  
3. You’ll see a **Chat panel** appear in VS Code.  
4. Sign in with your OpenAI/Microsoft account depending on the extension.  
5. Now you can ask questions like:  
   - “Explain FFT in simple terms.”  
   - “Generate a Flutter snippet for audio recording.”  

👉 Unlike Copilot, ChatGPT won’t autocomplete inline — it gives answers in the chat panel.

## ⚖️ How They Work Together
- **GitHub Copilot:** Inline code suggestions → fast boilerplate, repetitive tasks.  
- **ChatGPT Extension:** Conversational Q&A → explanations, debugging, brainstorming.  
- **Workflow:**  
  - Use Copilot to speed up coding.  
  - Use ChatGPT to understand errors, explore algorithms (like FFT), or brainstorm features.  

---

## 🎯 Your Cymatics App Development Flow
- Start coding in Flutter/Kotlin/Swift → Copilot helps autocomplete.  
- When stuck (e.g., mapping FFT output to visuals), open ChatGPT panel → ask for guidance.  
- Push code to GitHub → maintain repo with commits.

👉 Next, I can show you **how to configure VS Code for cross‑platform development (Flutter for Android + iOS)** so you can start prototyping your cymatics app with one codebase. Would you like me to walk you through that setup?
