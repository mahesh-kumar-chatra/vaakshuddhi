Excellent, Mahesh 👍 — let’s lay out a **step‑by‑step roadmap** for your cymatics-inspired mobile app so you can move from prototype to MVP efficiently.  

---

## 📅 Development Roadmap

### **Week 1–2: Foundation**
- **Set up project structure** (Android in Kotlin, iOS in Swift, or Flutter for cross‑platform).  
- Implement **basic audio recording** (using `MediaRecorder` / `AVAudioRecorder`).  
- Create a simple **UI with record/play buttons**.  

---

### **Week 3–4: Signal Processing**
- Integrate **FFT library** (TarsosDSP for Android, Accelerate/vDSP for iOS).  
- Extract **frequency spectrum + amplitude data** in real time.  
- Display a **basic waveform visualization** (bars or line graph).  

---

### **Week 5–6: Visualization Engine**
- Build **geometric mapping logic**:  
  - Bass → circles/ripples  
  - Midrange → polygons/lattice  
  - Treble → fractals/mandalas  
- Use **OpenGL ES / Metal / Flutter Canvas** for rendering.  
- Add **color/intensity mapping** based on amplitude.  

---

### **Week 7–8: UI & User Experience**
- Add **visualization mode selector** (e.g., “Sand Plate”, “Water Ripple”, “Fractal”).  
- Implement **playback with visuals synced to audio**.  
- Optimize performance for smooth rendering.  

---

### **Week 9–10: Export & Sharing**
- Enable **saving visuals as PNG/JPEG**.  
- Add **short MP4 loop export** for social sharing.  
- Integrate **share options** (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.).  

---

### **Week 11–12: Polish & Extras**
- Add **themes and customization** (color palettes, symmetry options).  
- Optimize for **battery and memory usage**.  
- Prepare for **beta testing** with a small group of users.  

---

## 🎯 MVP Deliverables
- Record voice/song → FFT → real‑time geometric visualization.  
- 2–3 visualization styles.  
- Export as image/video.  
- Simple, clean UI.  

---

👉 This roadmap keeps you lean and modular, so you can expand later (e.g., live streaming visuals, AR overlays, or syncing with music apps).  

Would you like me to **draft a sample Flutter code snippet** showing how to capture audio and run FFT as the first building block?
